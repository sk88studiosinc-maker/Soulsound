# SoulSound  
*A privacy-first, emotion-centered music platform for deep listening.*

**SoulSound** is a privacy-first, emotion-centered music platform designed to support deep listening, creative expression, and meaningful artistic growth — without algorithmic pressure, vanity metrics, or performative social mechanics.

This repository contains the MVP implementation and architectural foundation for SoulSound.

## 🚧 Project Status

SoulSound is in early MVP development.

This repository defines the intentional scope, philosophy, and architecture of the initial release.

The project is currently open to:
- Developer feedback
- System design discussion
- Aligned collaborators who value privacy-first, non-extractive platforms

## 🌌 Mission

SoulSound exists to create a **safe, intentional space** where music is experienced as an emotional and reflective journey — not a numbers game.

The platform prioritizes:
- Presence over performance
- Growth over virality
- Meaning over metrics
